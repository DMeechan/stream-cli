# Stream Chat CLI

Stream's Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to create and manage your Stream apps directly from the terminal. Currently, only Chat is supported; however, the ability to manage Feeds will be coming soon.

# 📌 Requirements

Only Node 8+ is supported. Node 6 will reach end-of-life April 2019. At that point we will continue to support the current LTS version of node. You can add the node package to your CLI to ensure users are on Node 8.
